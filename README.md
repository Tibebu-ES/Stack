# Implementation and application of a Stack Data Structure in Java.
This repository has two Java classes: **Stack** and **WordReverse**.
The firts class, **Stack**, implements the following operations:
  * **Push**: Add an element to the top of a stack
  * **Pop**: Remove an element from the top of a stack
  * **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty
  * **IsFull**: Check if the stack is full
  *Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it.
  
 The second class, **WordReverse**, demonstrates one of the many applications of Stack Data Structure, which is word reversing.
 It prints reversed word of the 'inputWord' attribute.
