# Implementation and application of Stack Data Structure in Java.
This repository has two Java classes: Stack and WordReverse.
The firts class, Stack, implements the following operations:
  -Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
  -Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
  -IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
  -IsFull: Check if the stack is full
  -Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it.
  
 The second class, WordReverse, demonstrates one of the many applications of Stack Data Structure, which is word reversing.
 It prints reversed word of the 'inputWord' attribute.
